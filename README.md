##### About
I created p0rtal to allow as much customization as possible to create a media server with exactly what you want. There is a huge pool of amazing media server related apps for you to choose from. The apps available range from Movie/TV PVR Automation to Media Servers to deliver your content, media organization tools and even tools to manage your server once its up and going. 

Check out the AvailableServices.md to see whats available as well as to find links to the project pages of these awesome services created by amazing developers.

Once youve decided what you want on your server, the individual files for each app chosen will be merged into one powerful docker-compose file that will control your server. Your docker-compose file can take you from a freshly installed system to your perfectly designed media server in minutes.
